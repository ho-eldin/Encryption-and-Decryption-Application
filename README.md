# Encryption-and-Decryption-Application
a simple form with two text areas and two buttons for encryption and decryption messages using the rule

## Rule:
In the context of the formula f(p) = (p + k) % 26, where p represents the plaintext and k is a fixed key, encryption is the process of transforming the plaintext into ciphertext. To encrypt a message, each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed amount (k) within the range of the alphabet (26 letters). The modulo operation (% 26) ensures that the result stays within the bounds of the alphabet. This process obscures the original message and makes it difficult to understand without knowledge of the key. The key can be substituted by any value.

Decryption, on the other hand, is the reverse process of encryption. It involves transforming the ciphertext back into plaintext using the same key. By applying the formula f(p) = (p + k) % 26 in reverse, the original message can be recovered. Each letter in the ciphertext is shifted in the opposite direction by the same fixed amount (k) to obtain the original plaintext.
